# Hackathon Submission Document

Please answer the following 3 questions with information about your project. When people are voting for your project from September 6th - 10th, this form will be a quick view of what your project is about.

## 1. What problem is your hackathon trying to solve and how does it relate to hackathon theme of ‘improving customer experience’?

Software bugs/faults are often caused by edge cases, untested scenarios or code paths that no one thought of or tested against, often because of the associated cost vs likelihood.

This project is about exploring chaos engineering (testing) techniques, and how to use them to more thoroughly test written software by adding a randomness element to the test cases, ideally without having to write too much extra code.

The customer experience is directly impacted by the quality of the software developed/maintained internally, and one way to improve robustness is to prepare for and experiment as much chaos as possible during development (as opposed to reacting to a customer issue or production outage).  


## 2. What technology (both hardware and software) did your team use to accomplish your goal?

- Python
- [Atheris](https://github.com/google/atheris)
- [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/)
- Openshift




## 3. What did your team learn from participating in this hackathon?

- TBD
